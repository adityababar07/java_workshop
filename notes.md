# function

-- function or method is a piece of code that is used to perform a specific task.

<hr>

# encapsulation

-- binding of data

# abstraction
-- hiding irrelevent data

# inheritence
-- child class inheriting properties of parent class

# polymorphism
-- many forms & it's a core concept that allows a single action to be performed in different ways. It enables you to write more flexible and reusable code.

The most common way this is achieved in Java is through method overriding, which is also known as Runtime Polymorphism.

|public -  access modifier(variable can be accesed outside the class)<br>
|static - don't want to mention or create object , only single copy<br>

| java is case sensistive and platform independent.

Case sensitive means that uppercase letters and lowercase letters are treated as different characters.

Example:

"Hello" ≠ "hello" (they are different because of the capital H)

"Apple" ≠ "apple" ≠ "APPLE"

Parameters → variables defined in a function/method signature (like placeholders).

Arguments → actual values you pass to the function when calling it.
